                        <p>
                            I am an engineer with a background in computer and electrical engineering, focused on embedded systems, low-level software, and computer architecture. 
                            My interests lie at the boundary between hardware and software, where system behavior, performance, and correctness are closely intertwined. 
                            I enjoy working with constrained systems and understanding how design decisions at one layer affect behavior across the entire stack.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My experience includes embedded firmware development in C/C++, Bluetooth Low Energy systems, RTOS concepts, and architectural modeling. I’ve worked with 
                            microcontrollers, development kits, and hardware debugging tools, and I’m comfortable navigating complex toolchains and technical documentation. I place a 
                            strong emphasis on first-principles reasoning and disciplined debugging, preferring to understand root causes rather than relying on trial-and-error fixes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I approach engineering problems methodically—breaking them down, validating assumptions, and iterating until the system’s behavior is well understood. 
                            I value clean design, maintainability, and clear communication, especially in low-level environments where small mistakes can have outsized effects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This page serves as a space to document my projects, ideas, and ongoing learning as I continue to grow as an engineer working close to the hardware–software interface.
